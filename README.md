# Energy-Prediction-Model

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

#### Objective:
Prediction Turbine Energy Yield (TEY)

#### Description:

Gas turbines are widely used in the energy production. In the present scenario, the quantity of the operating machines requires a special attention for prediction of power production in the energy marketing sector. Thus, the aim of this project is to support the sector by making the prediction of energy yield more computable. By using the data from an operating power plant, correlation and regression analysis are performed and model is developed to calculate energy yield.

It contains instances of 11 sensor measures aggregated over one hour (by means of average or sum) from a gas turbine located in Turkey's north western region for the purpose of studying flue gas emissions. The data comes from the same power plant as the dataset used for predicting hourly net energy yield. By contrast, this data is collected in another data range (01.01.2011 - 31.12.2015), includes gas turbine parameters (such as Turbine Inlet Temperature and Compressor Discharge pressure) in addition to the ambient variables. Data is sorted in chronological order. The dataset can be well used for predicting turbine energy yield (TEY) using ambient variables as features.
